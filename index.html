          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p id:"testP" class="funParagraph">
            Over the years, my family and I have frequently enjoyed camping
            together. Both my husband Edward and I are teachers, so camping has
            provided us with a budget-friendly way to get out and see the U.S.
            with our children, Tommy and Heidi. On this site you will see a few
            of my favorite campgrounds that we have visited. Each of these
            places has given our family many unique experiences and cherished
            memories together.

            We first experienced Colter Bay in 2018 when we took our three-week
            camping trip from Missouri to Mendicino, California. Colter Bay is a
            rugged campground nestled in bear country. As long as you keep your
            food and toiletries secure in the site’s bear box, you shouldn’t
            have any problems. That first trip to Colter Bay we didn’t see any
            bears. However, that wasn’t the case when we returned in 2020…that’s
            a story for another day. Wink. Wink. The best part about Colter Bay
            is that it sits right on Jackson Lake against the breathtaking
            backdrop of The Grand Tetons mountain range. There are serene
            lakeside beaches that you can easily walk to from your campsite and
            many rigorous hiking trails that take you into the foothills.
            Boating on Lake Jackson is also a great time!

          <p>
            D.L. Bliss gave us our first taste of California as a family during
            our 2018 trip. After driving through Nevada, we couldn’t believe the
            difference in scenery and landscape. The campground itself is tiered
            up against a very steep rocky wooded hill. Huge boulders were
            scattered all throughout. The kids loved this! And the pine cones
            were gigantic! Redwood pine cones, of course. The state park also
            had a lovely sandy beach on Lake Tahoe which you could access via a
            ridgetop trail overlooking the lake. I would love to camp there
            again.

            We used Summerdale as our base camp for Yosemite National Park (2018
            again). Just south of the park’s entrance, we were able to get an
            early start into Yosemite before all the RVs jammed up the highway.
            The campground also has a shimmery stream rambling through. If you
            follow it up the mountain side a bit you reach an elevated swimming
            hole where the water cascades over gigantic boulders. The swimming
            hole has sparkling yellow flecks of fools gold swirling all around.
            The kids loved swimming there…..until I saw panther scat, then it
            was time to go. The kids told me later on that I
            &quotoverreacted&quot.

            Bestsie River campground is a very special place to us. This is
            where we have camped the most with Tommy and Heidi starting back in
            2015. In fact, week-long Betsie River camping trips served as
            training missions for the kids before we set out on our 2018
            California trip. We have continued to return to Betsie River any
            summer that time allows. All year we dream about the sandy Lake
            Michigan beach and Frankfort’s lake town vibe, with its quaint shops
            and good food. The campground itself provides a fantastic breakfast
            in the camp store, where you can also purchase local Michigan ice
            cream and chocolate milk.

            A couple of years ago we discovered Hawn State Park. We wanted to do
            something over spring break, but we needed to stay closer to home
            because of Tommy's track schedule. Hawn’s setting provides spacious
            sites in a vast forest of protected land. (A school teacher named
            Helen Hawn donated this land to the state in 1952). We took
            advantage of the hiking trails and enjoyed a peaceful stay in the
            woods next to the gurgling sounds of Pickle Creek. We left more
            relaxed and happy than when we arrived.

            As our kids have gotten older we have had to make sure the camping
            trips include interesting things to do. Onondaga is perfect for
            that. Onondaga Campground sits alongside the Meramec River with a
            nice size gravel bar for playing around in the water. The entrance
            to Onondaga Cave is just a short walk from the campground. The
            campground provides tours of the cave, which I have now visited 3 or
            4 times. It is always stunning. My kids also enjoy float trips quite
            a bit. Just down the road about a half mile from the campground is a
            float trip outfitter called Ozark Outdoors. Not only can they set
            you up for a float, but they also have a multi-tiered aerial ropes
            course that even challenged my teenage son and his friends.

          <p>
            All these campgrounds hold a special place in my heart. Now that my
            children are older teenagers (19 &amp 16), camping together has
            become a rare treat. So, as their mother, the many campgrounds we
            have visited now symbolize dear memories of our time together. I
            hope you enjoyed hearing about these places. Maybe you will find
            yourself at one of them some day, ready to make memories of your own
            with the people you love.
